# About
I am a PhD student in social psychology at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, California. Having finished my coursework, but still deep in the throes of research, I have recently relocated to the Washington, DC area.

I am currently engaged in research on vulnerability to fraud with the [Neuropsychology of Decision-Making Laboratory](https://www.drstaceywood.com/wood-lab/) at Scripps College and have multiple years of experience in the field of program evaluation, having worked with programs that serve a variety of populations including LGBTQ youth, parents and teachers in early childhood care programs, secondary school students in college prep programs, and homeless veterans. My primary research interests are in the areas of *motivation* and *social bias*.
