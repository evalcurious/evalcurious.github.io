A colleague and I had the opportunity to share some of the lessons we have learned about data visualization with our colleagues at the [American Evaluation Association](http://www.eval.org/) during the 2016 annual conference. This blog post published on the [AEA365 blog](https://aea365.org/blog/internal-eval-week-making-data-meaningful-to-non-data-people-by-ana-flores-and-joshua-paul/) presents some additional thoughts we had regarding our presentation and a follow-up to questions we received from the audience.

We hope our experiences and thoughts will be helpful to others who are trying to determine the best way to share data with their stakeholders.
